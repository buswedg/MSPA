    "In this last required assignment you'll be working with and examining email data from the Enron Corporation, which infamously collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001.  The email data was compiled by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for investigative and litigation purposes.  It is now available from diverse sources and in various forms, and it has been researched by many. You can find out about this data at:\n",

You can prepare prepare it for download by using the Mongo shell on the SSCC, or you can get it by accessing the MongoDB directly by using the Mongo client, or from within a Python session using the pymongo package.  See the document `sscc_sps_tutorial_1_2_3_4_5.pdf` that's on Canvas for examples of using either method. Given your Python experience you might find the latter method easier.  The data you want are in the `messages` collection in the `enron` database that include \"klay@enron.com,\" Ken Lay's email address, somewhere in the message, either in a header or in the message body.  Lay was the Enron CEO at the time of the bankruptcy.  These are the messages you want to download.\n",
