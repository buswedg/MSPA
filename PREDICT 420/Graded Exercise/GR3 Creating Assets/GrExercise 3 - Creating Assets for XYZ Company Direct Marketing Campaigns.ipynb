    "In this exercise you will create two data \"assets\" for use by the XYZ company in direct marketing campaigns.  You will download from a SSCC server to your local computer, create a relational database for it that you'll store locally, and create a \"flat\" file with selected customers and variables.  You'll document your work by providing the code you used and some summaries of the data.  You'll save the new assets you created for future use and for sharing with others.\n",
