		"Content": "Most stylish hotel in university district I travel to Seattle several times a year and am always looking for new places to explore. No more. I've found a home with hotel Deca. Their rooms are so stylishly decorated that the Intimon Theater replicated them on stage for a play. The staff is knowledgeable about the area and goes out of their way to be helpful. This is the U Washington area with numerous eclectic restaurants and cafes, and intriguing shops. I'm a hiker. I discovered several gorgeous trails within a mile from the hotel. If you're visiting a friend at the University, or if you're too familiar with the tourist areas and hotels of Seattle., try the Deca! It's comfortable, stylish, and located in a great area for exploring !",
