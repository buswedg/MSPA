		"Content": "SCAM SCAM SCAM - BEWARE!!! The hotel is absolutely terrible - It pays airport and bus station taxis to con you into staying there even if you have accomodations elsewhere .The lobby looks perfectly fine - but once you pay for the room you find out the place is in absolute shambles - nothing works in the rooms - they are old dilapidated and very gross - DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!! There is an excellent hotel less than a block away - Hotel Regente - It is absolutely first class and actually costs less if you book on the internet - $ 57 USD",
