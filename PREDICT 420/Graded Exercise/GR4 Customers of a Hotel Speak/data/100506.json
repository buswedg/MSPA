		"Content": "This place is not even suitable for the homeless take my advice and stay far far away! We booked only because every where else in town was full and looked at the last review and thought ok great location and comfortable beds, made all the previous ones seem possibly an exageration. NOT AT ALL people believe me you will hate this place! Upon arrival we were greated by a woman that could not speak english hardly at all, unable to answer our questions about the age of the hotel, parking, etc. Upon check in we got our room keys and were placed on the 9th floor on the way up the elevator which sounded horrible BTW the elevator stopped on the 2nd floor to pick up another rider going up, I about vomited right there the carpet was so terribly stained and the smell emitting from that floor was horrible, We made it to the 9th and although stained carpet not even half as bad as the 2nd floor we were a bit more hopeful. We booked a standard double room, and that's what you get, a tiny double sized bed, old linens, filthy carpet, gross tiny bathroom but we had running water and heat so decided to make the most of it. We all (2 couples 2 rooms) headed out on the town upon arriving back at our hotel, the elevator was out of service we were told the stairs were our only choice, 9 stories later exhausted we finally made it to our rooms and literally fell exhausted into our beds, we awoke the next morning only to learn the elevator was still out of service, meaning we got to haul all our luggage down 9 floors, filthy staircase and something all over the stairs of the 4th to the 2nd floor made it treacherous as well. Today being 4 days later my muscles still ache I've yet to hear back from the manager (we requested some sort of a discount) I'm betting we won't hear back and we chalk it up to learning the hard way. I'd much rather stay in a hostel or sleep in a park then ever step foot in this horrid excuse for a hotel again!!!! GROSS...... seriously need a hazmat suit to enter.",

		"ReviewID": "UR119896310",
		"Content": "This hotel is so bad it's a joke. I could barely sleep because the place is so ghetto, you sit in your room worried about your safety and your valuables. The elevator crawls up squeeking the whole way with no certificate of inspection or weight limit posted. The room looks like somethig out of the 70s. Holes in the sheets, no toilet paper roll, just sitting on the sink, an old water furnace with peeling paint (is it lead based?). The TV has about 5 working chanels and has a hole in the plastic. The wiring is obviously shoddy and I found a working outlet on my third try. The heat runs so hot and does not adjust. You have to open a window. The window has no screen and I was on the 8th floor (Do Not stay here with a child). The wallpaper was badly peeling, exposing mold and mildew on the walls. I can only imagine how poor the air quality was. No WiFi in the room. The neighbors next to me were having relations loudly and the walls are paper thin. After hearing the walls bang for a few minutes, I had to get some fresh air. The surrounding area is full of homeless and shady characters. There is a terrible bar in the basement that attracts scumbags and white trash who hang out in front of the entrance. The thing is, this room cost me $95!!! I've got great hotels in other major cities, Chicago, NY, Orlando for this range that are great. This is a Roach Motel that is best suited for drug use and prostitution. It should offer hourly rates. I took off my watch and ring just to make sure no one was casing me out. The worst part is that the website is completely misleading. Any positive reviews seem like ownership tring to do damage control on the reviews.",

		"Content": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel from 16th July to 18th July. We selected this hotel purely for the excellent location and for the cost. But frankly we were in for a shock when we arrived at the hotel directly after disembarking from a cruise. There was only one person at the front desk and he bluntly told us that check-in was only after 3pm. Since it was a long wait (we reached the hotel at 11am) we requested that we be allowed to leave our luggage. Luckily he agreed., So we left and returned only later in the evening. There was only one lift and that was so ancient just like everythinhg at the hotel. The room was smelling awful and looked very dull and unwelcoming. There was free wifi only in the lobby. The bathroom was only just adequate as the toilet seat was wobbly and almost broken. There was no kettle or microwave anywhere in the hotel. We just managed to survive for two nights only because it was conveniently located to the Pyke Marketplace ,space needle and the sea front. Luckily there were good restaurants and Starbucks close by . I will think twice before staying again at this hotel",

If you need space to spread out this isn't the place for you but if you plan on enjoying the room just as a place to drop your things and go enjoy the city than this is the perfect place. The location was fantastic and the staff was friendly and helpful. The hallways made me feel like I was in a dream. I loved the decor!! Very artistic, not like any other place I have ever stayed. I was a little concerned because I had seen that this hotel was listed on the bed bug report. I called ahead of time to inquire about this issue. I spoke to the general manager who told me that bed bugs have now come to Seattle and they are a problem in the industry and any hotel at any time could have them. He also assured me that they bring in dogs to check the rooms on a regular basis and if any are found they are properly exterminated. I don't think you can ask for anything else. We had no bed bugs in our room! Yea! Anyhow the place is great! I would go back for sure. Give them a try.",

		"Content": "The hotel is in a very convenient location, just a few steps from the University Street stop on the transit tunnel for free city centre busses or light rail. The price was very reasonable. The hotel was clean with regards to day to day cleaning - the lobby, corridors, toilet, shower were all clean, and the room was dust free with fresh smelling sheets on the bed, which whilst it was not the most comfy bed I have ever slept in it was OK. Deeper down bits of the hotel have seen better days. There was a rusty pipe and loose wallpaper in the corner of both my friends bathroom and my bathroom, both of our bathrooms had filthy suspended ceilings, there was also a bit of loose wallpaper in my bedroom and the TVs only worked on a few channels, in my room only one non religious channel in fact, and that was the \"Opra Winfrey Network\" - could not get any morning weather or news. Also the Wifi was in the loby only and it was a nightmare - the man on reception had to keep resetting the router. No breakfast in the hotel, they reccomend you go to the restaurant underneath for breakfast but it sounded expensive to us so we went to a nearby Subway instead. This hotel was OK for us for the price as we spent very little time in the hotel except when asleep. I would not have wanted to spend an extended amount of time in the room though.",

		"Content": "I am just a college student visiting Seattle, and without looking into greater detail about the hotel I was making reservations with, I got stuck with Hotel Seattle. I stayed one out of two nights, and raised hell to get my money back for the second night. Again- MOLD in the bathroom. the shower backing was coming off the wall, and inside was disgusting, horrible cultures of something I don't know. Like a previous woman stated, I was terrified to sleep with the lights off. I didn't feel safe AT ALL. The entire place was creepy- the lobby is falling apart, the elevator you don't know if it's going to hold you; I felt genuinely scared and uncomfortable. When I got to my room, the windows were open and the oil heater was on. I couldn't figure out how to turn it off and suffocated in a hot room when I went to sleep. Eventually had to re-open the windows to hear the loud sirens, trash dumping noises, and strange animal cries at 2 AM. There are NO SCREENS on the windows, so YES, YOU OR YOUR KIDS COULD FALL OUT OF THE WINDOWS. Is that legal? I don't know. There was a metal object in my sheets, the sheets didn't even fit on the bed, the shower water was inconsistent, the bathroom dirty and hot, the hotel service TERRIBLE, holes in the walls, and cracks in the ceilings. The guy acted like I was crazy for asking for a refund. No one was friendly to me. I will never step foot in this terrible place ever again, not to be paid even, as someone else said. No sleep will be gotten here, just a stiff neck and a load of anxiety about the safety of you and your things. Spend a little more for a hotel you can feel safe in. No human being deserves to stay in such a mold-infested dump. OH YEAH- pay $10 for wifi for one day.",

There are only two hard backed chairs in the room to sit on; otherwise there is only the bed. This hotel in general needs TLC. We observed unfinished repair projects which showed wires sticking out of the light indicator above elevator, unfinished \"window transom\" above lobby entrance, and lots of little things that wouldn't take much time to finish to give hotel a nicer appearance. Some things were just annoying like the only useful plug-in for an equally useless hairdryer (which you have to check out at the desk, I think they only have one) is on the FAR opposite wall from the mirror in the bathroom. The noise from the hallway sounds as if the people in the hall are in your room with you. It is enough to say the staff could give a rip!!! This attitude just trickles down from the manager so forget about appealing to someone higher up.

The maid watched impassively as we put down our luggage and stuggled to move her cart without offering any assistance as we moved it aside to get into our room.

But as one reviewer said \"it is like a budget overseas hotel\" and I have stayed in several that were in similar condition and I just enjoyed the experience. The check in and desk service was great. We asked for extra pillows from the maid and got them. We also spent $5 for flowers at Pike Street and they added character to the room. Location is everything. Our friends stayed at the Fairmont across the street and we stayed for 3 nights what one night cost them. My money went to dinners, trip to Victoria and baseball games.",

Although the first two nights there were pleasant with the windows open for a breeze in the room, the last night was extremely hot and uncomfortable due to a heat wave in Seattle. The hotel had no small fans available for use in our room. In addition, the hotel provided no ice. In fact, the front desk clerk told us we could have all the ice we wanted if we went down the street and bought it at a local convenience store. No hairdryer was provided either. Overall, our experience at this hotel was much less than desirable, especially since the room rate was higher than we usually pay for the usual amenities, i.e., air-conditioning, hair dryer, ice machine, mirror near beds, etc.",

There was some street parking available (the desk clerk pointed that out to us) during the week (don't know about how crowded it can be on the weekends). And there is a garage right up the street if there isn't any street parking. We were in Seattle for a wedding and wanted an inexpensive hotel downtown that was close to Pike Market, restaurants and other attractions and this fit the bill. The front desk staff was very very friendly helping us find restaurants and directions back to the airport. If you just want a place to sleep (because you'll mostly be out touristing, if you aren't looking for luxury, don't care about matching furniture, or city noises, this hotel is perfect. The beds were clean and comfy and I really liked the pillows. The room was cleaned both days and fresh towels delivered. I read all the previous reviews and was concerned but decided it would be an adventure and if nothing else we would have a good story. But after staying there I realized that expectations really vary amongst guests. We felt safe, slept well, had nice staff encounters. If you want luxury, and newer accommodations, then by all means stay at the \"mocking\" W hotel. But if you were reamed liked we were on the airfare and don't have the money, stay here. Its funky, old, centrally located and has a nice staff. ps. The photographer who shot the lovely photo of the room did and amazing job, and possibly knows a lot about photoshop. Our room paled by comparison. But that's OK",

We called them directly and booked the stay. The staff was very nice and none of this review is meant to reflect on the them in any way. We understood that this was a moderate priced placed to stay but did not expect the what we found. The rooms are dark and dank and look like something that comes out of film noir. The bathroom had paper rolling off of the walls; it took two to three flushes for the toilet to flush. it was the most depressing place I have ever stayed in. We knew immediately upon arrival in the room that we could not stay there for 3 nights, so we took steps to find other acommodations and were fortunate to find them. We had to stay one night and I spent that entire time awake. We were at the nearest coffee shop at 5:30 a.m. and left in a taxi by 8:30 a.m. I write this review out of concern for others who plan to stay there. It was not a pleasant experience. Beware.",

The shower head was loose.............the list is endless. We payed$96 plus tax. For that amount I expected a basic clean room. I have stayed in many hotels over the years and I can truly say that this hotel ranks as the worst I have ever stayed in.

		"Content": "The staff was nice. That's about the only nice thing I can say about this place. The photos of the hotel are very misleading. Standing outside looking at the hotel, you have to wonder if the photo on their website has been doctored at all. The photos of the rooms were obviously taken at a different hotel because the room I was put in, and then moved to another looked NOTHING like the room photos on their website. As someone else said in a previous review about this hotel, don't walk around the room without your shoes and socks on. Definitely not a romantic getaway (unless you're trying to break up with someone.) The sheets had hair on them. I requested a non-smoking room, but you could tell that someone had smoked in it previously. There was no air condtioning or a fan. Big deal, it's Seattle, right? Wrong. It was 90 plus degrees during my stay. The windows do open though, providing little relief. Cable television? Non-existant. I was told that sometimes it comes in, and sometimes it doesn't. What does that mean, really? It's sad when you pay $96 a night and can't even get the local channels (NBC, ABC, CBS.) Go on the internet for your news? There is no internet, unless you want to setup your laptop for dialup. The restaurant downstairs was a dive. Again, the service was great, but as with the rooms, you could tell that management didn't quite care about upgrading anything. Several times during my meal, I could have swore I saw something scurrying across the floor. The waitress seemed embarrassed while attempting to relieve me of my worries. I forgot to mention the lobby. The sofa was very comfortable. In fact, it may have been the nicest thing in the entire hotel. However, don't lean your head back while on the sofa or you'll notice that there is paint peeling off the ceiling in large chunks held together by duct tape in places. Speaking of duct tape, there was actually duct tape holding the carpet together in several places. The room I stayed in had scotch tape holding the wallpaper over this gaping hole. Security risk? Room keys have the room number and hotel name on the key ring. So, don't bring anything valuable, because who knows how often the locks are changed and if previous customers have lost their keys on drinking binges in Pioneer Square. There is no room service. It looked like there was only one person there at all times. If you're hungry, don't eat the food in the vending machine. Both the pretzels and Twix candybar were past their expiration date. At check out, staff was apologetic for the things I told them, but obviously not at fault. While you could sense their understandable frustration through their body language (not quite making eye contact, embarrased look on their face), you got the feeling that they hear about similar guest experiences on a regular basis. It's a shame because it's in a great location. You almost wonder if management is even in it to make money. I never did hear back from them after I sent a letter detailing my disappointments. I highly recommend not staying here. Avoid at all costs.",

For the price in downtown, its hard to beat. Also, be advised they have no parking (typical for seattle), there are 2 huge parking garages though within a block or two of the hotel so you shouldn't have issues with that.",

		"Content": "Pros: Good safe downtown location. Walking distance to market, downtown stores, etc. Room and bathroom were clean. Request the non-smoking floor. Pleasant desk staff. Two coffee places around the corner. Cons: Looks like it hasn't been redecorated since the 1950's. An OK place if you want a simple place to sleep and shower. For the same room rate, the Executive Pacific Plaza (about 1/2 block away) is much nicer.",

		"Content": "I've never had a worse experience at a hotel, and I travel a lot for business. The place is a dive...old, dirty and grungy. Not to mention, they charge for services not rendered, and refuse to issue a credit, even in the case of an innocent mistake. Don't waste your time here, not even for their cheap rate!",
